    How do I pick a court?
  content: |
    Massachusetts has 7 trial court departments:
    
    * District Court
    * Boston Municipal Court (BMC)
    * Superior Court
    * Housing Court
    * Probate and Family Court
    * Juvenile Court
    * Land Court
    
    The District Court, BMC, and Superior Court are all courts that can hear
    any type of case. The Probate and Family, Juvenile Court, and Housing Court
    are all **specialist** courts that hear one kind of case. They have may
    have judges with special training as well as special resources available.
    
    For example, the Housing Court has trained mediators, a special
    program for tenants with disabilities, and legal help available on-site
    on the day that eviction hearings are held.
    
    Different courts can make different kinds of decisions. Not every court
    can give you every kind of help. For example, you cannot file a housing
    discrimination case in the District Court. You cannot ask for vistitation
    in the District Court in a family law case.
    
    Depending on where you live, different courts may be further or closer to
    your address. There are about 100 district courts all over the state,
    but each county has only one or a few Superior Courts or specialty
    courts.
    
    Choosing a court means thinking about what kind of help you need, as well
    as which court you can get transportation to on the day of your hearing.
    
    Only you know the right choice.
